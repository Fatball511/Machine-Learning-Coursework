Files for Decision Trees model:
Training_model_1
Testing_model_1
Final_model_1

Files for Random Forests model:

Training_model_2
Testing_model_2
Final_model_2

For Decision Trees:

1. Run the Training_model_1 first, you will get the trained model and performance in training set

2. Then run the Testing_model_1, you will get the performance in testing set


For Random Forests:

1. Run the Training_model_2 first, you will get the trained model and performance in training set

2. Then run the Testing_model_2, you will get the performance in testing set
